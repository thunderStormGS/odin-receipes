# odin-recipes
A basic recipe website, assigned by The Odin Project's Foundations Course. In this project, I used basic HTML and elements such as ordered and unordered lists, headings, images, and anchors to assemble a main page, along with three recipes. Done in Visual Studio Code, git was used to push various changes and corrections to this project and to publish it onto Gihub.
